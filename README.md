Fly.io Deployment Link - meal-planning-helper.fly.dev

Two or more examples of things we enjoyed:
- We enjoyed working with the flask login and understanding how to authenticate a user and how to register a user to our database. Reading the documentation was much easier to follow than other aspects of the project.
- We enjoyed working in a group, we stayed in communication and helped each other out when one of us would get stuck. What really helped was that we would meet in person to discuss the project as well as work together real-time to build the website. 

Two or more examples of things we didn't enjoy as much:
- Deploying the app and making sure all the features worked was a bit difficult. 
- Doing the pull request was tricky to understand as well. We didn't make separate branches for our pull requests, just merged to the main branch every time.

Technical Requirements:
- App runs on Flask server written in Python
- Postgres database to save recipes from Spoonacular API
- REST API Integration using Spoonacular
- User login using Flask Login
